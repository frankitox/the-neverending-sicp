# About

This is just an indecent public exhibition
of my tries on the SICP. Maybe you would
like to peek for a new twisted and poorly
written version of the exercises, you'll be
pleased. BTW, there are interactive versions
of the book, video lectures and a couple of
blogs which take the challenge seriously.
You can find that links on the right side of
the dead [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sicp).
Good luck!
